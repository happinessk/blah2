lead: Let’s work together to design services that empower your team, better serve the public, and tackle the big problems facing your agency.

We can work with you to explore and define a variety of problems, and then we can help you build or buy a solution.

Because of our limited resources, 17I is not able to take on every
project that agencies propose. We select our projects through a
qualification and evaluation process led by our Partnerships
Team. If you and 17I decide that we’re the right fit for a project and
we have the necessary time and resources, we’ll work with you to draft
the necessary documents to begin our partnership. You can read more
about how we work with agencies in our [Partnership
Playbook](https://pages.atx.gov/partnership-playbook/).

Do you have a project in mind? Let us know: [17I@codeforsacramento.org](mailto:17I@codeforsacramento.org)
